# Vretta Violations API Server

This API server captures and manages security violations from the Vretta Soft Lock assessment platform.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

Or for development with auto-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Violation Types

The system tracks various types of security violations:

- `focus`: Window focus changes (switching applications)
- `copy`: Copy operations
- `paste`: Paste operations
- `virtual-copy`: Virtual clipboard operations
- `context-menu`: Right-click attempts
- `shortcut`: Blocked keyboard shortcuts
- `navigate`: Navigation attempts
- `tab`: Tab switching
- `devtools`: Developer tools access
- `window`: Window manipulation
- `general`: General security violations

## File Storage

Violations are automatically saved to daily log files in the `logs/` directory:
- Format: `violations-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- Each file contains an array of violation objects

## Integration

The trigger page (`index.html`) automatically sends violations to this API when:
1. The server is running
2. Security mode is activated
3. A violation occurs

## Production Deployment

For production use:
1. Replace in-memory storage with a proper database
2. Add authentication and authorization
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Add proper logging and monitoring
5. Use environment variables for configuration
6. Set up HTTPS

## Environment Variables

- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development/production)

## Testing

You can test the API using curl:

```bash
# Log a violation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/violations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"test","message":"Test violation","timestamp":"2021-12-31T12:00:00.000Z"}'

# Get violations
curl http://localhost:3000/api/violations

# Clear violations
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/violations
```
